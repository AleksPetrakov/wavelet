# Wavelet Analysis of Stock Data (LUKOIL)

This project performs wavelet analysis on LUKOIL stock prices using Python. The analysis visualizes different wavelet transforms applied to the stock's closing prices over time, helping to identify trends and anomalies.

## Features

- Wavelet transform of LUKOIL stock price data using various wavelet families.
- Visualization of original and transformed data.
- Supports multiple wavelets: `bior1.3`, `coif3`, `db5`, `rbio3.5`, `sym8`.

## Usage

1. Ensure the stock data (LKOH.ME.csv) is present in the directory.
2. Run the wavelet analysis:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Example Output

The output includes a plot comparing the original LUKOIL stock prices with the results of the wavelet transforms.

## Requirements

•	Python 3.x
•	pandas
•	matplotlib
•	pywt

## Install the dependencies:
